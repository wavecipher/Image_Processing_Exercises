:)

# Counting Coins
Using the Canny edge detector, we extract the contours of the coins and count them using findContours.

# Image Enhancement
Two different ways to enhance underexposed night pictures using Global histogram equalization and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE).

# Image Restoration
Restoring a scanned image by first fixing it's rotation. The lines are then restored utilizing morphology.

# Solving Puzzle
Segmenting puzzle pieces and matching them to the correct positions in the image grid.

# Tampering Detection
Detecting tampering between two nearly identical images by first aligning them and then subtracting the differences.
